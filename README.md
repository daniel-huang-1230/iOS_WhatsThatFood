# iOS_WhatsThatFood
WhatsThatFood is my first personal iOS project. Scheduled to launch in appStore in mid/late September, 2017. The final official
name of of the app may change.

The original idea for this simple application is to created a personalized, costimizable food journal for all your favorite 
(or not so favorite) dishes/restaurants. This iOS app is inspired by the 10-week project that me and my classmates did back 
in UC San Diego during the winter of 2017 ( course name: CSE 101-Software Engineering). 

The old project was a team effort that was written in Java based on Android devices only. This time, I decided to go solo and 
re-create the app with Swift 3.0 and Xcode 8.3 on iOS mobile devices. 

This project is intended to help me learn Swift programming language, and more importantly, the ins and outs of iOS app 
development, including but not limited to OOP design pattern, prototyping, Auto Layout, animation, adaptive design, Beta testing, MapKit, CloudKit, Core Data, launching on App Store, etc.

Note that the current UI design as well as most predefined images are from the book I am recently reading, "Beginning iOS 10 
Programming with Swift" and I do not own the copyrights of them. However, the final product will all be work of my own.


The following screenshots demostrate all the features that have been successfully implemented.
